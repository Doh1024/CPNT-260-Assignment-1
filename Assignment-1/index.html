      <b>Valorant</b> is a first person hero shooter developed by Riot games. It was first teased in October 2019,
      began a closed beta period with limited access on april 7, 2020, followed by the official release on June 2, 2020.
      Valorant is inspired by Counter-strike which is a tactical shooter game. Valorant and Counter-strike has a lot of 
      similarities such as buy menu, inaccuracy while moving, guns and map design. Although valorant has gotten lot of hate 
      from "copying" Counter-strike at first but now it is one of the most played games as of right now.
